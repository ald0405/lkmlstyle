- title: Name of count measure doesn't start with 'c_'
  code: M100
  rationale: You should explicitly state the aggregation type in the dimension name
    because it makes it easier for other developers and Explore users to understand
    how the measure is calculated.

- title: Visible dimension or measure missing label
  code: XD100
  rationale: |
    Dimensions and measures that are visible in the Explore page should have a label
    so users understand how and why to use them, along with any caveats.
